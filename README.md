# Hi there, I am Holger. 

Since I was 16 years old I love programming. I guess I was born with a great passion to create software.

I’m currently working as a C# developer on Window and I do a little bit of iOS and macOS development in my free time.

❤️ Love to learn and love to teach

📱 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS development

💬 Ask me about my love for Japan
