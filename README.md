# Hi there, I am Holger. 

Since I was 16 years old I love programming. I guess I was born with a great passion to create software.

I’m currently working as a C# developer on Window and I do a little bit of iOS and macOS development in my free time.

❤️ Love to learn and love to teach

📱 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS development

# What I am working on

## Random Person Generator

I have to admit, when I started this project, my knowledge of the MVVM design pattern in WPF was a bit rusty. For too long I had been occupied with other topics. A simple layout and styles, yes that should still work. But what about a DataTemplate? Or a HierarchicalDataTemplate? I should do that again, otherwise I'll unlearn it. A small program should help me to find the connection again and at the same time create a basis to try new things. For a long time I thought about what kind of data my program could display only to end up loading again with personal data.
