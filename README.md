# Hi there, I am Holger. 

Since I was 16 years old I love programming. I guess I was born with a great passion to create software.

I’m currently working as a C# developer on Window and I do a little bit of iOS and macOS development in my free time.

❤️ Love to learn and love to teach

📱 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS development

# What I am working on


## FileNameFixer

Getting consistent file names for your own file can be a time-consuming task. 
Especially if the files are downloaded from the Internet and contain unnecessary filler words. 
Often dots are used instead of spaces or the upper and lower case are ignored. 
This program will take care of this problem and renaming files will become a breeze.

## Random Person Generator

I have to admit, when I started this project, my knowledge of the MVVM design pattern in WPF was a bit rusty. For too long I had been occupied with other topics. A simple layout and styles, yes that should still work. But what about a DataTemplate? Or a HierarchicalDataTemplate? I should do that again, otherwise I'll unlearn it. A small program should help me to find the connection again and at the same time create a basis to try new things. For a long time I thought about what kind of data my program could display only to end up loading again with personal data.

## SwiftUI Feature Demo

SwiftUI evolves quickly. Every year there are new functions that need to be learned and tried out. I have created this project to do just that. It is my playground.  It is also my reference to see how things work in action.
